How do I approach designing software?
--------------------------------------------------

The new design skills that I took from this project is OpenGL as a whole. Going into this class I had never worked in OpenGl and it was
something that I never heard of before. This class taught me a new was of being able to develop a 3D arena without programs like Blender,
3DsMax, Maya, Cinema4D and Unreal. The design process that I used for this work was difficult for me. As the tutorials were diffrent
than how I approached my project and I had to take a new apprach. I took it one step at a time to make sure that I was understanding what
I was coding rather than just going through the motions. The one apprach that I can apply to the future is the patience that I had in this
project and to take my time.

I am a hands on learner so it was very difficult for me to learn one way and then have to apply another to how the project actually came out.
I think that all of the strategies that I used, such as researching more outside of the resources that were given and getting to know the
craft that I was working with. While it took longer than I wanted I finally got a good handle on how to use the program after diving deeper
into an understanding of the program. Frustration was a huge discouragement to me. While I learn fairly easily this was something that was
a true challenge and took longer for me to tackle. There were days when I wanted to give up but I kept going knowing that I could understand it better if I did. The milestones helped me in so many ways. I started with the most complex thing in my project. So when it came to do the surrounding environment it was easy for me to understand and grasp what I was doing.

While my goal with computer science is to change rehabilitation within the healthcare system, I believe that OpenGL will come in great uses.
As I want to work in immersive virtual reality and I think this is something that I can take with me and apply to that goal.
